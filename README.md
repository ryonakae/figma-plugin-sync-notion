### "Sync Notion" button

Sync all text contained in the selected element. If nothing is selected, all text on this page will be synced.

### "Sync with Highlight" option

If this option is enabled, highlight all text that has correct layer name format: `#<Key Name of Notion>`.  
Text is highlighted in blue if the key is correct and in red if it's incorrect.  
It is useful to check that the layer names are formatted correctly or that they have no typos.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Create a reverse proxy to avoid CORS errors

Here are the steps to create a reverse proxy in [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).  
(This is just one example.)

- Sign up or login to Cloudflare Workers.
- Select "Workers" from the menu. Then create a new service.
  - The service name can be any name you like.
  - e.g., `https://reverse-proxy.yourname.workers.dev`
- After the service is created, click "Quick Edit" to open the editor.
- Enter the following code into your editor. Then click "Save and Deploy.

```
addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    if (url.pathname === "/") {
      return new Response(`
        Usage:\n
          ${url.origin}/<url>
      `);
    }

    if (request.method === "OPTIONS") {
      return new Response(null, {
        status: 200,
        ok: true,
        headers: {
          "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
          "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS",
          "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Authorization, Content-Type, Notion-Version"
        }
      });
    }

    let response = await fetch(request.url.slice(url.origin.length + 1), {
      method: request.method,
      headers: request.headers,
      redirect: "follow",
      body: request.body
    });
    response = new Response(response.body, response);
    response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS");
    response.headers.set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Accept, Authorization, Content-Type, Notion-Version");

    return response;
  } catch (e) {
    return new Response(e.stack || e, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

- Now you can access any API with the URL: `https://reverse-proxy.yourname.workers.dev/https://any-api-url` without any CORS errors.

The URL entered into the "Notion API URL" field of this Figma plugin is `https://reverse-proxy.yourname.workers.dev/https://api.notion.com` (not required for "v1" and later).
